#Hi there! Lines that look like this are called COMMENTS.  Python will completely ignore any comments, so no matter what I say in here, Python ignores it!
#The only commented line you need to type is that funny looking one at the beginning, as it tells terminal that this is a python program.
#Without having that at the beginning, your program simply won't work.
